  I have a husband, Ben, who I adore and a daughter, Amilia, who I absolutely
  treasure. I have a passion to see people loved, cherished and gain a sense of
  belonging. I live in one of the most beautiful parts of the world, The
  Illawarra, NSW.

<h3>Why I became a Doula</h3>
<p>
  I have always had a passion for mums and babies, but I think it became even
  stronger after the birth of my daughter. I was shocked at how disconnected I
  felt from my care providers and how much information I had to source for
  myself that really should have been coming from them. I had a beautiful birth,
  but it made me wonder, are other women getting enough information to have a
  birth experience that they are at peace with?
