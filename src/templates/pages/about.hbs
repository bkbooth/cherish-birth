      I am married to a wonderful man, Ben, and together we have 3 adorable children.
      I have a passion to see people loved, cherished and to gain a sense of belonging.
      I live in one of the most beautiful parts of the world, Illawarra, NSW.

    <h3>Why I became a Doula</h3>
    <p>
      I have always had a passion for mums and babies, but I think it became even
      stronger after the birth of my daughter. I was shocked at how disconnected I
      felt from my care providers and how much information I had to source for
      myself that really should have been coming from them. I had a beautiful birth,
      but it made me wonder, are other women getting enough information to have a
      birth experience that they are at peace with?
