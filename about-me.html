      <p class="justify">
        I have a husband Ben who I adore. A daughter Amilia who I absolutely
        treasure. I have a passion to see people loved, cherished and gain a
        sense of belonging. I live in one of the most beautiful parts of the
        world, The Illawarra, NSW.

      <h3>Why I became a Doula</h3>
      <p class="justify">
        I have always had a passion for mums and babies, but I think it became
        even stronger after the birth of my daughter. I was shocked at how
        disconnected I felt from my care providers and how much information I
        had to source for myself that really should have been coming from them.
        I had a beautiful birth, but it made me wonder, are other women getting
        enough information to have a birth experience that they are at peace
        with?
